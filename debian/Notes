	Built Libraries
	---------------

graph	static 	shared
python		shared
regex	static	shared
signals	static	shared
test    static
thread	static

The static-only libs are incorporated into boost-dev
package.


	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* libs/graph/src/Makefile
  - build using optimization and no debugging
  - disable rules that invoke yacc
  - do not clean the yacc-built files

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_parser.cpp
  - add std:: prefix



	STLPort and GCC 3
	-----------------

Boost built using GCC 3 passes the regression testing.  This is
the default GCC now, so stlport is no longer used.


	Documentation
	-------------

TODO: httrack is now in debian, so this can be revised...

I couldn't figure out the correct wget options to copy the local tree
while not downloading stuff from other sites.  Xavier Roche <roche@httrack.com>
told me about httrack <www.httrack.com> which does precisely that using

  httrack file:///usr/local/src/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/index.htm -%F ''

I'd like to use httrack to do the copy, since it cleans up a bunch of
sloppy links, e.g. adding slash to href="foo.bla.com/".  Alas it ain't
part of debian.  So I used the copied files to generate the list
debian/libboost-doc.docs.


* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree
