	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* project "status" is not built; there are many
  build failures there that need to be investigated

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* libs/thread/src/once.cpp
  - add closing brace fix, taken from CVS

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_parser.h
* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.c
* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.h
  - bogus changes, due to running bison at build time



	Documentation
	-------------

Using wget to make a copy of the HTML docs.

--mirror
  Equivalent to --recursive --timestamping --level=inf --dont-remove-listing

--dont-remove-listing
  Don't remove the temporary .listing files generated by FTP retrievals.

--recursive
  Default recursion depth is 5.

--directory-prefix=prefix
  Set directory prefix to prefix.  Default is ".".

--relative
  Follow relative links only.

 -i file
  read input from file


I couldn't figure out the correct wget options to copy the local tree
while not downloading stuff from other sites.  Xavier Roche <roche@httrack.com>
told me about httrack <www.httrack.com> which does precisely that using

  httrack file:///usr/local/src/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/index.htm -%F ''

I'd like to use httrack to do the copy, since it cleans up a bunch of
sloppy links, e.g. adding slash to href="foo.bla.com/".  Alas it ain't
part of debian.  So I used the copied files to generate the list
debian/libboost-doc.docs.


* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree
