	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* project "status" is not built; there are many
  build failures there that need to be investigated

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* libs/thread/src/once.cpp
  - add closing brace fix, taken from CVS

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_parser.h
* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.c
* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.h
  - bogus changes, due to running bison at build time



	Other Notes
	-----------

* check that texinfo is truly needed to build
