	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* libs/graph/src/Makefile
  - build using -I/usr/include/stlport, optimization and no debugging
  - disable rules that invoke yacc
  - do not clean the yacc-built files

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_parser.cpp
  - add std:: prefix

* tools/build/gcc-stlport-tools.jam
  - use "-lstlport" for static linking



	STLPort and GCC 3
	-----------------

The Boost libraries depend on a conforming stdc++ library.  I tried
building boost using GCC 2.95.x (the default on most Debian
architectures as of this writing), and it fails some of the regression
tests.  However, using the same compiler plus STLPort suffices to pass
the regression tests.  Thus Boost is built using STLPort and the
packages depend on the STLPort packages.

See http://www.boost.org/status/cs-linux.html.

It is also true that GCC 3 passes the regression testing, so when
that is default everywhere I'll no longer build with stlport.

If you prefer to use Boost with GCC 3, you need to get the sources and
rebuild it yourself.  I'm afraid that requires hacking the following
files: debian/control, debian/rules, and tools/build/debian-tools.jam.


	Documentation
	-------------

I couldn't figure out the correct wget options to copy the local tree
while not downloading stuff from other sites.  Xavier Roche <roche@httrack.com>
told me about httrack <www.httrack.com> which does precisely that using

  httrack file:///usr/local/src/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/index.htm -%F ''

I'd like to use httrack to do the copy, since it cleans up a bunch of
sloppy links, e.g. adding slash to href="foo.bla.com/".  Alas it ain't
part of debian.  So I used the copied files to generate the list
debian/libboost-doc.docs.


* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree
