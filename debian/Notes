signals		static	shared
test    	static	shared
thread		-	shared

The static-only libs are incorporated into boost-dev
package.


	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* libs/graph/src/Makefile
  - build using optimization and no debugging
  - set -DYYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED=1


	STLPort and GCC 3
	-----------------

Boost built using GCC 3 passes the regression testing.  This is
the default GCC now, so stlport is no longer used.


	Documentation
	-------------

Generate the list of documentation files using wget going through
localhost to get the source tree

    wget -r --no-parent --domains=localhost \
	http://localhost/lsrc/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/index.htm
    cd localhost/....
    rm -rf boost
    for f in `find * -type f`; do 
	test -f /usr/local/src/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/$f && echo $f; 
    done > documentation-files

* need to symlink .../HTML/boost to /usr/include/boost; when put the symlink
  into the deb, it got converted to a directory during installation; use
  postinst script to do it

* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree
