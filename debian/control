Description: Boost.org libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 For the following subprojects separate packages exist: 
 date-time, filesystem, graph, python, regex, signals, test, and thread.

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 Part of the Boost.org library collection.

 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
 importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.

Section: python
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Boost.Python Library 
 Part of the Boost.org library collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.

Package: libboost-regex1.32.0
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost.org library collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Depends: libboost-dev (=${Source-Version})
Replaces: libboost-dev (<< 1.32.0-3)
Description: serialization library for C++
 This is a partial list of provided functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 serialization: the reversible deconstruction of an arbitrary set of
 C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

Package: libboost-signals1.32.0
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: managed signals and slots library for C++
 Part of the Boost.org library collection.

 called publishers or events in similar systems. Signals are connected
 to some set of slots, which are callback receivers (also called event
 targets or subscribers), which are called when the signal is
 "emitted."
