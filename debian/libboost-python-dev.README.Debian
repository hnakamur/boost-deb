The BOOST Python library is intended only for use in constructing
a Python module, so only a shared library is supplied.

David Abrahams, the upstream maintainer posted this to the BOOST
mailing list.

  1. AFAIK libboost_python is only useful from a shared lib (python
  module) -- oh, I suppose you could use it for embedding python in
  another app, but I've never tried it, and libboost_python.so would
  work just as well, wouldn't it?

  2. It was originally implemented as a static lib just because that's
  much simpler to get right across platforms. There was no
  libboost_python.so. Since a static lib on Unix is just an archive of
  .o files, those .os had to be shared-linkable.

  3. Eventually I made libboost_python.so as a replacement, which
  saves lots of space in every extension module. I kept
  libboost_python_static.a, as I've said, to keep people who were
  attached to using the static lib happy.
