This software is a collection of libraries from the Boost.org site.
The libraries use various licenses, but all follow these guidelines:

License requirements

    Must be simple to read and understand. 

    Must grant permission to copy, use and modify the software for any
    use (commercial and non-commercial) for no fee.

    Must require that the license appear on all copies of the software
    source code.

    Must not require that the license appear with executables or other
    binary uses of the library.

    Must not require that the source code be available for execution
    or other binary uses of the library.

    May restrict the use of the name and description of the library to
    the standard version found on the Boost web site.


The individual copyright and license statements appear in the headers,
in /usr/include/boost.  

In general, the licenses tend to be BSD-inspired with language such
as the following example:

// (C) Copyright Jens Maurer 2001. Permission to copy, use,
// modify, sell and distribute this software is granted provided this
// copyright notice appears in all copies. This software is provided
// "as is" without express or implied warranty, and with no claim as
// to its suitability for any purpose.
